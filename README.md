Lucky Number Django Game:

This is a simple number guessing game built using Django.

When the user opens the site, a random number is generated between 1 to 10.

The user has only 3 chances to guess the correct number.

I built this project after learning the basics of Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
It helped me understand how frontend and backend work together in a real web application.

Tech Stack I used for this project :

For Backend: Python 3, Django

For Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript

IDE: VS Code  

ForVersion Control:** Git & GitHub
